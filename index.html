        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>By the end of this lesson, you will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>have a basic understanding of token-based authentication</li>
          <li>recognize the underlying structure of a JWT</li>
          <li>be able to implement a protected route and API endpoint by verifying a JWT</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Authenticating SPAs with JSON Web Tokens</h2>
        <p>Authenticating your single page applications means that any application data being transmitted must be done so in a verifiable, and trusted manner. This includes scenarios such as user logins and API requests to send and retrieve application data. Despite how important it is to keep these issues in mind while building applications, many launch without any precautions in place. While security is a much bigger problem than weâ€™re aiming to solve here, there are some standards we can take advantage of to boost the integrity of our applications.</p>
